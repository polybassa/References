On IT-Systems a port scan is usually performed as a first step of an investigation. Since the communication protocols differ in automotive systems, generic port scanning tools can’t be used for a security analysis of Control Area Networks (CANs). More complex protocols have a higher likelihood of implementation errors and bugs. On CAN networks, such payloads are transferred through International Standard Transport Protocol (ISO-TP) communication. We designed a new methodology to identify ISOTP endpoints in automotive networks. Every of these endpoints can provide exploitable application layer protocols and therefor has to be considered during penetration testing and security analysis. We contribute a new scan approach for the automated evaluation of possible attack surfaces in automotive CAN networks which has a higher coverage and multiple advantages than state of the art approaches.}, booktitle={Computer Science in Cars Symposium}, publisher={ACM}, author={Weiss, Nils and Renner, Sebastian and Mottok, Jürgen and Matoušek, Václav}, year={2020}, month={Dec}, pages={1–8} }
